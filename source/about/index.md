```JavaScript
console.log('Hello, World!');

I am **Baptiste Vannesson** (aka **Badacadabra**), a modest Internet citizen from France.

As far as I can remember, I have always been driven by a devouring intellectual curiosity and, to some extent, obsessed by the Socratic paradox. I work hard everyday to escape the Plato's cave, absorbing some drops from the vast ocean of human knowledge.

**Free/Libre and Open Source Software** (FLOSS) is my religion. I do believe that proprietary licenses conflict with basic freedoms of the modern world. Let's share software, my friends!

On this blog, you will read technical articles; mainly about **JavaScript**, **Vim** and **GNU/Linux**. If you find articles helpful or if I make a mistake somewhere, feel free to comment. You can also follow me on social media because, if you are here, we probably have interests in common...
